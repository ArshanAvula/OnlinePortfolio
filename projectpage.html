                <h2>Type/Name: Entrepreneurship Project</h2>
                <h2>Course: Computer Science Essentials</h2>

                <p>One project where I demonstrated growth and learning while having a role in the project was the most recent project, Entrepreneurship Project. In this project, I took initiative and action for our group by taking the group leader role. In this role, I had to manage my group and make sure they were on task, manage deadlines and tasks for our group, and most importantly, become one of the main developers for our group. In this project, we decided to make an app to help students manage their tasks. Our first idea for our main feature for the app was to make a user login page, so that they're data would be stored and saved in an API and a server. However, we learned from our mistakes and underestimated how hard it would be to implement such an idea. We moved on and demonstrated growth by creating a new main feature, as the test prep page. This page would allow the user to plan specific events and deadlines. The other page was the schedule page, where the user can plan whatever tasks they have for the week and save it onto their computer. The final page was the study page where the user can time manage their assignments using a timer and/or stop watch while listening to calm music. All of these pages could be accessed by a dashboard page, where the user can easily navigate through the app. Two skills I learned that pertain to my interest, which is computer science, were programming test samples for my project and my basic HTML and Java Script coding skills towards the project. These skills helped our group a lot because I used the test samples to validate and make sure our code didn't have any bugs, and I used my basic coding skills towards HTML and Java Script by coding the rest of the app. Using my leadership skills and communication skills, I eventually contributed a lot to our team and project.</p>

                <h2>Type/Name: Project 1.1.6 App Development - Creative Expression</h2>
                <h2>Course: Computer Science Essentials</h2>
                <h2>Duration: October 19, 2023 to November 1, 2023</h2>
                <p>Another project where I demonstrated growth and learning while having a role in the project was the 1.1.6 PLTW Project (Creative Expressions). In this project, I paired up with another teammate, and as a duo, we coded our app. I took the group leader role, as well as the main developer. In this role, I had to make sure that our app was working and I was finishing my parts of the code on time. My partner had to make sure that there were no errors, so he debugged and tested the code. We decided to make a ping pong game, where the user can use paddles to hit the ball back and forth across the screen to score points against each other. However, this idea didn't work out due to MIT App Inventor not having the feature of using two conditions at the same time. It only allowed one paddle to move once at a time. We learned from this mistake and developed a new idea, but with similar features to the famous pong game. We demonstrated growth by changing the idea to a single pong game, where the user can use the paddle to hit the ball away from the bottom floor. Over time, as the ball bounces around, the ball gets faster, which makes a much more challenging and fun game for the user. The UI was very simple, with a paddle, ball, and a score tracker, as well as start and reset buttons. Two skills I learned that pertain to my interest, which is computer science, were managing tasks using scrum and using pair programming. These two skills helped my teammate and I to work more efficiently as a duo, and helped us manage our time and tasks for the rest of our project. The detailed plan allowed us to carry out tasks and finish the project on time and effectively. In the end, using my coding and teamwork skills, I contributed a lot to our team project.</p>
